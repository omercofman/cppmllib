# cppmllib
I am doing this as an exercise of both C++ and ML for myself.

My Goal is to implement ML algorithms from scratch in a fast and as compatible for C++11 and up versions as possible.
Free to use for everybody.

In this point I am going to add functionality to the lib. After I will get the gist of it I will structure it better with classes.
